From augmented reality to video-guided sales, the impact of tech on the buyer journey cannot be overstated. Yet, the effects of technological developments on the other side of the fulfillment chain have not reached their full potential when it comes to the scalability of existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Warehouse Management System WMS) and Order Management Systems (OMS) systems.\nDropshipping as a key logistical strategy The dropship model has exploded in popularity in the last several years. E-commerce soared during the pandemic and dropship players emerged everywhere, trying to get their share of the pie. Dropshipping as a business model offers many advantages. Overhead and operational costs are low, upfront costs are practically non-existent and you don’t risk any unsold goods taking up precious warehouse space. Sellers don’t need to agonize over what products will sell, how to stock them, and at what levels these items need to be kept in stock. However, several pitfalls can easily skim your margins or even tank your dropshipping business. The most common reasons behind dropshipping failures include stock shortages, higher fulfillment costs, and customer service issues. It all comes down to inventory: visibility and control More important than the inventory itself is the question: who manages it? Unlike in conventional retail, the seller does not handle the inventory at all. Instead, your supplier handles all storing, packaging, and shipping of the products to the end customer. The model is shifting at an incredible pace where large online retailers who managed large warehouses and inventory now rely on individual manufacturers to ship products directly to the end customer. This has resulted in several challenges around visibility on goods available on the premises of the individual small manufacturers. This lack of visibility results in stockouts, backorders, reduced revenue, higher-order handling costs, and ultimately unhappy customers.\nComplexities around digitization As online retailers scramble to the dropship model, existing ERPs (Enterprise Resource Platforms) and WMS (Warehouse Management System) that are built around handling large volumes in central locations now struggle to scale to handle volumes across extremely fragmented distributed locations.\nTop 5 challenges: fulfillment as the core of the issue  Reliance on third-party suppliers High level of competition Tight profit margins Difficult customer support: potential high rates of product returns Inability to buy in bulk Dropshipping market size  According to research by Market Data Forecast, the global dropshipping market size was worth $128 billion in 2020 and will grow by 32% from 2021 to 2026. Nearly a third of online retailers have adopted the dropshipping model. A market study from Research \u0026amp; Markets estimates that the global dropshipping market will reach $591.77 billion in 2027. Unsurprisingly, retailers using the dropshipping model can earn 50% more profit versus a conventional, inventory-holding model. On average, dropshippers make between 20% and 30% from each sale.\nConclusion Ultimately, what matters most to the customer is the experience of receiving the goods they ordered, at the service level they expect. This means within a certain timeframe and at a certain quality level. Any deviation from these leads to a decreased customer experience, customer satisfaction, and as a result, likelihood of returning in the future.\nPrecise inventory control: Ventory can help Visibility around these fragmented distributed locations is key, both forward in the fulfillment process and backward through the supply chain. Ventory Connect – Ventory’s smart extension to ERP systems and WMS systems – allows online retailers to scale and deploy their existing WMS and ERP system capabilities by offering an extension of their systems to digitize these fragmented distributed locations and convert them to a single connected virtual warehouse. This approach gives online retailers the much-needed control and visibility of inventory across their partner network. This new approach allows online retailers to offer significantly improved visibility at a far lower cost as they no longer need to offer their dropship partners access to their existing IT infrastructure.\n Start your trial  No obligations, no credit card required, cancel at any time  ","date":"14","image":"images/blog/2022-02-14-dropshipping-challenges-inventory-visibility-logistics-boxes.webp","permalink":"https://www.ventory.io/blog/2022-02-14-dropshipping-challenges-inventory-visibility/","tags":["Stock management","Inventory"],"title":"Challenges surrounding dropship business for major retailers: visibility, control and inventory management"},{"categories":["Inventory Management"],"contents":"Too much stock? Excess inventory is a liability, even more so in the renewable or solar industry. We have identified the top 5 most common inventory management challenges specific to the renewable or solar industry.\nThese challenges are made more urgent by the rapid rise in innovation in recent years. Significant advancements happen in solar panel technology every new year, helping improve their energy storage capabilities and efficiency. Also, inverters and batteries are becoming cheaper and smarter.\nTherefore, having out-of-date equipment in your warehouse means it continues to depreciate, and offloading it will be a challenge, even if you offer significant discounts. It’s no secret that solar energy customers want nothing but the latest technology.\nInadequate inventory can hurt too. If you are low on stock or even stock out for multiple installations, this could impede productivity. You’ll also face unhappy customers.\nTop 5 challenges The following are the 5 most common inventory management challenges faced by companies in the solar and renewable sectors:\nChallenge #1: Limited Inventory Visibility Many solar companies experience difficulties identifying or locating products in their inventory. In fact, not many even know what stock they have or don’t have in their warehouses. Such situations make it difficult to fulfill orders. The result is unhappy customers.\nThis limited inventory visibility also leads to inaccurate, incomplete, or delayed shipments. Your crew will miss critical equipment to complete installation, impacting your reputation and bottom line.\nChallenge #2: Manual Documentation As mentioned earlier, most companies in the renewable industry are yet to digitize. That means they still document their orders and inventory manually in Google or Excel worksheets, on a whiteboard, or by email. However, this stunts the distribution of data and limits potential.\nYour Operations and Maintenance team cannot know what’s available or what’s not available to complete solar installation and maintenance.\nDoes it also mean that your Asset managers have to move from one location to another recording the solar panels out there? And what happens when a customer no longer wants your solar services? Manual documentation makes this difficult because establishing where all your tangible assets are is hard. It’s time consuming and daunting. In fact, Asset Managers dealing with manual documentation often look disorganized.\nChallenge #3: Identifying Incorrectly Located Parts Lack of a digitized system or a centralized inventory hub to track equipment or products in-store is the main cause of incorrectly located parts.\nOften, it takes the Operations and Maintenance team a lot of time searching for specific equipment needed for solar maintenance somewhere.\nOften, it takes the Operations and Maintenance team a lot of time searching for specific equipment needed for solar maintenance somewhere. Sometimes such a search is unfruitful. The crew ends up picking the wrong material or equipment, delaying service and causing customer dissatisfaction.\nChallenge #4: Inaccurate and Unknown Inventory Levels Consider a scenario where your Operations and Maintenance team promises a customer that a particular inverter or battery is available, and you’ll have your crew install it the following day, only to find that the ordered item is unavailable in your warehouses.\nYou’re going to have an angry customer simply because you don’t have solar inventory management software that precisely indicates what you have or don’t have.\nRemember, although most companies can afford to stock more, you can’t. The solar industry is evolving pretty fast, and you don’t want to find yourself with a warehouse full of obsolete equipment.\nAlso, solar products often experience times of rapid devaluation. Yes, it may help you meet customer demand at the very least. But it will cost you when you have to sell your panels at a loss.\nSince you do most of the inventory for solar companies in the field, it’s easy to find your Asset Manager accounting for stock in warehouse floors without considering stock in transit.\nChallenge #5: Changing Demand Several external factors affect customers’ decisions to purchase. While some of these might be similar to other industries, others are unique to the renewable sector.\nEven international, federal, and state incentives can shift market demands. Businesses and consumers tend to invest in solar products during months approaching incentive or rebate expiration dates. They prefer to switch when the government incentive is likely to be highest.\nFailure to prepare for such changes due to improper management can strain your tracking. Your asset managers cannot predict a rise in demand and advise you accordingly on the equipment to invest in at such times?\nAt the same time, it puts pressure on the Operations \u0026amp; Maintenance team because they cannot keep up with competitors in the job sites.\nTake your business to the next level with these best practices Which of these 5 common challenges are present in your company? After identifying your top 5 solar company inventory challenges, the next step is to step up and improve.\nFirst, identify your why’s and how’s. Then digitize your solar inventory management and bring all stakeholders on board. That way, your Asset Managers, and Operations and Maintenance can adhere to a gold standard on solar inventory management.\nHere are seven solar inventory management best practices to guide you:\n Invest in solar inventory management that helps you collect, aggregate, and get insight into data from all your warehouse locations. Sort your inventory into categories. Most people prefer the ABC categorization method. Reorganize your warehouse layout for maximum efficiency. For example, it should take the least time possible for an employee to get a battery or inverter. Practice demand/inventory forecasting. It’ll help you be ready in advance. Automate everything you possibly can. Have an auditing strategy in place, especially for your assets. Maximize inventory turnover. It helps increase profitability.

That is where warehouse management systems (WMS) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software come in. These systems keep warehouse operations running smoothly and efficiently by consolidating inventory information and streamlining supply chains.\nWMS and ERP solutions are simply not made for inventory outside the warehouse. Decentralized inventory throws a wrench into conventional warehouse management systems, with consequences for productivity and revenue. In this article, you will learn why WMS and ERP are not enough, what the consequences of using conventional WMS and ERP solutions can be, and how to ensure proper inventory management outside of a warehouse.\nWMS Challenges Today, WMSs face two major challenges in managing inventory outside of the warehouse:\n“Invisible” Inventory Most warehouse management systems focus on and excel at tracking stock as it enters and leaves the warehouse. But not all inventory leaves the warehouse en route to a customer, especially in the healthcare and renewables industries. Field inventory exists in tandem with the warehouse system, but may not be accurately tracked by most WMS software. Spare parts, in particular, do not enter or exit the warehouse system like the rest of your inventory. Vital equipment, like replacement solar panels that live on-site for quick repairs, can vanish from standard WMS tracking. Trunk stock carried by sales representatives and service engineers can also be hard to track, which leads to opacity in the selling process and confusion about the location of important tools and equipment.\nThe Complexity of WMS Because warehouse management systems strive to be all-encompassing software solutions that integrate with several ERP systems, they tend to be highly detailed and complex systems. The level of automation for day-to-day operations offered by a WMS can vastly increase efficiency—if they need all that. For smaller businesses with fewer moving parts, highly complex WMS can interfere with operations. It can also put a strain on the budget, which can motivate some businesses to stick to Excel spreadsheets for managing inventory. While the Excel spreadsheet may be tried-and-true for small businesses, it simply does not hold up to scaling or integration with WMS and ERP systems. It is an either/or affair: either your warehouse management is all manual, or all run on WMS software. Massive multi-tab Excel sheets do not play well with software designed to integrate with other software—leaving out-of-warehouse inventory out in the cold.\nWhen WMS Systems Fail When your WMS software isn’t flexible enough to handle your inventory, the efficiency of your supply chain is at risk. Here are some of the consequences businesses face when warehouse management systems cannot meet the challenge of tracking field and distributed inventory:\nStock Shortages and Revenue Loss You do not know your total inventory if you never know what trunk stock sales representatives have with them and what has already been sold. Products left unaccounted for can expire, leading to revenue losses and unexpected shortages. An estimated $5 billion per year is lost in the medical device industry alone to poor inventory management. Minor inconsistencies in inventory tracking snowball into massive waste, over-and under-estimation of supply, and ultimately, significant loss of revenue for your business. When it comes to spare equipment and replacement parts, you may be faced with a crisis. If you do not know exactly where your spare parts live, you will not know where to find them when you need them. Slowdowns in production and last-minute sourcing of replacement parts lead to further revenue losses.\nLoss of Productivity Tracking down inventory should be quick and painless—not a major part of your workday. In short, the more time you spend chasing down distributed inventory and sorting through endless Excel sheets, the less time you spend running your business. In medical settings, this can mean time needlessly spent manually inputting information on used or expired medical devices, when staff could be focusing on their primary jobs. Loss of productivity leads to backups in your supply chain, as processes that should take hardly any time at all start to eat away at work time until you have lost hours of productivity.\nImpacted Customer Relationships As the hours wasted on tracking down distributed inventory pile up, the likelihood of costly delays increases. Inefficient WMS systems can lead directly to strained customer relationships as inventory gets lost, found, and delivered on unpredictable schedules. These days, customers like to keep a close eye on their property as soon as it is purchased—and radio silence from you means customer frustration. Since tracking requires cooperation and integration with existing workflows and enterprise resource planning systems, customer stock also requires special attention. Play too fast and loose with either, and you may find yourself losing important business relationships.\nBest Practices for WMS and ERP These two companies exemplify smooth integration to track and manage out-of-warehouse inventory.\nCentraCare Health Inventory management can be especially difficult in rural areas, where shipping between storage locations quickly becomes time-consuming and pricey. That’s why Minnesota-based CentraCare Health utilizes Oracle’s ERP software to manage inventory across the eight hospitals and dozens of clinics in their rural healthcare network.\nTitan Solar Power In the solar power industry, field inventory is too valuable to get lost in manually updated spreadsheets or go unrecorded completely. One of the top-rated installers of residential solar panels in the U.S., Titan Solar Power, uses Blue Banyan’s SolarSuccess software to streamline operations, including managing distributed and field inventory.\nHow Ventory Can Help Solve WMS Challenges Where other WMS software fails to address the challenges of managing field inventory, Ventory understands that modern businesses have complicated warehouse management needs.

Having a successful customer experience strategy can alleviate the need to compete on products, prices, or for certain markets. The new generation of customers rely and take advantage of the digital tools available, and they expect their purchasing to be simple and easy, and their orders to be delivered quickly, on time, in full, and with high quality.\nIn times of strong competition, сustomer centric inventory management is necessary These expectations put businesses in a constant search for innovation whether driven by technology, digitization, or new processes and ways to serve their customers. It is no longer sufficient to perform a minimum list of tasks but instead focuses on developing new approaches, techniques, and best practices to ensure customer loyalty.\nA customer centric solution is one practice that can help your business go beyond the norm!\nСustomer centric inventory management puts the customer at the center. It focuses on accurate analysis of market trends, customer purchasing patterns and more, in order to predict the future customer needs even before they realize themselves. Customer-centricity goes way beyond basic customer expectations and takes a leap forward in delighting customers.\nBy now you might be wondering – How can I tell if our inventory management practice is customer-centric…? If you are working on predicting customer behavior and their future needs by analyzing and making sense of customer information, purchasing models, reasons for demand fluctuations, market trends, and you are looking at your inventory management practice to enable that model, you might be already taking advantage of customer centric inventory management.\nWhat are the signs of customer centric inventory management? In this article, we will cover 5 ways to check if your inventory management is customer centric.\n1. How quickly can you identify and meet exceptions to current customer demand? Customer demand can be unpredictable due to a number of external and internal factors. If a company wants to consistently meet customer demand, it will require them to hold a higher level of cycle and safety stock in their warehouses. But this has an impact on the operational and inventory holding costs. The more safety stock a business keeps the more likely it is to meet unplanned customer demand, but this comes at a higher operational cost and impacts the bottom line.\nA customer centric solution in inventory management has the built-in capability to identify and meet unplanned customer demand. This means that fluctuations in customer demand, whether one-off or permanent shifts, can be easily accommodated and served. Inventory planners would closely collaborate with demand planners, buyers, and analysts to ensure that exceptions are not just understood, but also included in the forecasting models for future use. The system has embedded a continuous learning and analysis loop to improve the forecasting models and bring the prediction as close to the actual demand when materialized.\n2. Can you keep up with the evolving customer needs? Customer needs are evolving at a rapid pace. Driven by the eCommerce growth, customers today expect faster deliveries, more accurate delivery windows, high quality and reliance on digital tools for visibility. Research from Forrester mentions that the B2B eCommerce market is expected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2023, with COVID-19 accelerating that growth even faster.\nA customer centric inventory management puts agility and flexibility at the core. This means that the system has a built-in capability to respond to volatile market changes and keep up with the pace of the customer needs.\n3. Can you provide a personalized customer experience? One strategy companies use to build customer loyalty is providing tailored experiences. These experiences can range from how the customer orders the product, to how, when, and where the product is delivered. Many companies attempt to balance between standardization efforts which require treating all customers the same, and customer experience strategy which requires flexibility, agility, and a unique approach. A 2020 Accenture survey, showed most companies lack the flexibility to deliver differentiated customer offerings on-demand.\nAn alternative can be grouping customers in segments based on similar characteristics and needs and providing a unique value proposition for each segment. A customer centric solution in inventory management will require your business to build a multi-channel supply chain strategy based on the unique value proposition for each customer segment.\nIn addition, you can capitalize on machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide a personalized experience and give customers what they want, where, and when they want it.\nIn the aforementioned survey, Accenture has shared an example of a company that achieves great results in this area – Inxception. Inxeption is an e-commerce company that provides a platform for small and medium-sized industrial companies to list, sell and deliver products. Thanks to a recent partnership with UPS, their customers can track transactions from registration to delivery.\n4. Do you include customer feedback in your supply chain? Customer centric inventory management, uses customer feedback purchasing patterns, and analysis of evolving customer needs at each stage of the buying process. Predictive analytics based on customer purchase behavior add significant value in determining the amount of products to be produced and stored at each location.\nCustomer feedback and market trends are embedded in each stage of the supply chain driving quality and innovation. Reliance on real-time visibility and demand sensing can enable your business to provide a top-of-the-line customer experience, resulting in customer loyalty, repetitive purchases, and increase in top-line results.\n5. Do you have real-time visibility? Visibility plays a key role in exceeding customer expectations, and here we speak about visibility on both fronts – for your customers, and across your manufacturing and supply chain processes. Customers will ask for real-time updates and tracking for their deliveries, when placing orders they will prefer to see whether the product is available and when they could receive it, and much more.\nTo achieve this, you will need to build visibility for every node within the supply chain, collaborate in real-time with your stakeholders down and upstream, embed digital tools to allow you to model capacity and what-if scenarios, and plan proactively for future and unplanned customer demand.\nWith a customer-centric inventory management you can strengthen your competitive position Moving to a customer centric inventory management can be a mundane task. It will require a transformation of your business and buy-in from your internal and external partners. Most importantly, it will need a paradigm shift from reducing operating costs to delighting customers. That said, such a decision will pay off in the long term. Delighted customers become loyal customers. They return, become ambassadors for your business, and propel your business growth.\nVentory is a no-code Inventory Management solution that allows businesses to digitize their field inventory and spare parts.

Warehouses play a key role in satisfying the needs of your customers by storing products in anticipation of future demand. But, running your warehouse operations with a pen and paper model or google/excel spreadsheets can significantly impair your ability to serve your customers in the best possible way. If you are struggling with back-orders or lack of visibility on your stock levels and its location, it might be time to consider implementing a Warehouse Management System (WMS software).\nHow does WMS software help in warehouse optimization? A WMS software can significantly improve your warehouse optimization efforts. It can automate most of the warehouse processes and increase productivity, freeing up time for your workers to focus on value-added activities like serving your customers. A WMS software can ensure that products move through your warehouses in an efficient and cost-effective way, by handling functions like inventory tracking, picking, packing, and shipping products, receiving and putaway of products among others.\nIf you are at the stage where you are considering implementing a WMS system, you might be asking what your options are and how you should go about it. A common mistake we see when organizations choose a WMS system is to only focus on the basic functionality and the cost of the software. But, there is much more to be considered in the selection process…\nTo help you with your selection, we will share our view of the Top 6 Open Source WMSs in 2021\nDifference between a traditional and an open source WMS You might be asking yourself what is the difference between an open source WMS and a traditional WMS provider? An open source WMS is publicly available, meaning the underlying design and software code is available for anyone to access, modify or update. A company or a group of individuals can create the software and will make it available for anyone to use for free, through a service like GitHub.\nWhat are the six Open Source WMSs we have identified? 1. OpenBoxes It is a free WMS software that focuses on inventory management and tracking the movement of goods for healthcare facilities.

Their application is seen in many aspects of our daily lives (from light bulbs that can change intensity or color to suit your desire to large industrial solutions).\nInnovative solutions that intelligently monitor and control remote sensors and devices are revolutionizing enterprise computing. These next-generation intelligent systems capture, analyze, and enable organizations to act on the massive amounts of raw business data generated by a vast array of endpoints to improve business intelligence and automate business processes.\nBut, is IoT inventory management always practical and efficient? Does it drive value for your business?\nIn this article, we will consider IoT inventory management pros and cons. Although, IoT inventory management there are some pain points that IoT cannot solve.\nWhat are IoT inventory management pros and cons for management? Let’s start with the benefits IoT inventory management can provide for your business:\n Communication. IoT uses machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, which drives full transparency, greater efficiency, and higher quality. Monitoring. The second advantage of IoT is monitoring. Knowing the exact amount of your stock, its location, expiry, and/or warranty dates, drive productivity and efficiency Automation and Control. IoT inventory management allows greater automation and control. Without the need for human intervention, machines can communicate with each other, which leads to faster and more timely action. Money. The most significant advantage of IoT is saving money. The IoT forces devices to communicate effectively saves energy and costs. Cost Management and Reduction. The cost of deploying an IoT device has seen a downward trend over the last 10 years. $40 a piece in 2012 to less than $2 a piece in 2020, followed by an increase of battery life from 2 to 5 years) allowing businesses to easily deploy them and improve their cost management.  Situations not solved by IoT inventory management Now that we covered the key benefits of IoT inventory management, let’s go through some of the limitations and what IoT can do with those limitations.\n Presense of human error:\nWhy? Until we reach a stage of full end-to-end automation, we will have people involved in the processes. And this means human error can happen. While asset tracking systems have improved over time, they still cannot eliminate human errors. Yes, IoT inventory management is more likely to detect an error: a load delivered to the wrong platform.\nHow can IoT inventory management mitigate this? Despite the limitation, IoT inventory management will still allow us to learn about errors earlier in the process and give us time to react and potentially prevent irreversible and/or dangerous scenarios. Asset tracking systems detect problems as they occur. Dependence on people:\nWhy? Workers still play a significant role in the daily management of factories and warehouses. They are involved in the handling of the products, working with the machines, searching for lost products, or preventing damages. While IoT inventory management can track the assets and update records, the work of technicians, operators of heavy machinery warehouse staff cannot be replaced.\nHow can IoT inventory management mitigate this? IoT inventory management can be of significant help to workers. With the data received from the IoT devices, they can become more efficient and effective in their daily tasks and responsibilities. Manual processes and labor:\nWhy? As mentioned in one of the previous points, the daily management of factories and warehouses relies on many manual processes and involves manual labour. Most businesses have automation to some extent, but not all the way through. While automated accounting for the location of your assets will save workers a lot of effort, it does not guarantee that every product is in the right location. Employees thus need to move that product to the correct location.\nHow can IoT inventory management mitigate this? IoT inventory systems such as ultra-wideband (UWB) RTLS or Bluetooth with low power consumption (BLE) will reduce the physical effort of the end-user. For example, introducing an autonomous updating of logs or stocks when moving items will reduce the need for the employees to maintain the warehouse management systems. Process harmonization across the business:\nWhy? IoT inventory management will not automatically harmonize your processes across the business. Implementing IoT devices with siloed processes will hinder your overall benefit and visibility.\nHow can IoT inventory management mitigate this? The good news is that asset tracking technologies are designed to solve problems and present opportunities. We recommend you take a step back and look at your end-to-end processes when implementing IoT devices, and define how they will drive benefits not just for inventory management, but for your business in general.  Let’s see two real-life examples of how Amazon and DHL have used IoT inventory management in their businesses:\n Amazon Warehouse Automation: Amazon uses semi-automated IoT inventory management where robots work alongside store managers. Basic tasks like scanning barcodes and moving packages are outsourced to IoT devices. Amazon’s automated warehouse employees have 400 robots to perform these essential tasks. IoT devices enable warehouse managers to track inventory, improve productivity and make the entire supply chain process smoother and efficient. DHL Smart Warehouse: DHL has piloted an extensive range of IoT devices at its warehouses. The organization uses robots, smart glasses, autonomous vehicles, and drones in its warehouse. These IoT devices enable store managers to identify products and sort through parcels quickly and efficiently.

Hence, your inventory should be correct and aligned with supply and demand variations. However, companies persistently use outdated spreadsheets or Excel inventory management system!\nInventory is one of the company’s most valuable assets, and if managed inefficiently can have a significant impact on every element—from the customer, field users, to the boardroom.\nFor Instance, spreadsheets are commonly used across businesses of varying sizes to manage field inventory, and for a good reason: they allow anyone to perform ad hoc, custom analysis. But they end up employed frequently as a long-term solution rather than a temporary remedy, and their capabilities quickly get outgrown.\nIf your company relies on Excel or Google Sheets to manage inventory, chances are you are underperforming in areas of efficiency and profitability, even though you feel you are making progress!\nThat said, here are some key reasons why spreadsheets might be holding your inventory management back and why it may be time to replace Excel with an alternative.\nImpractical and Time-consuming You may think of spreadsheets as a perpetual inventory solution. However, your employees need to update inventory management spreadsheets manually and constantly. Employees spend more time adding, reviewing, and correcting data instead of working with insights to make effective decisions.\nSpreadsheets can also create multiple versions of the truth, which can become hard to manage. It relies heavily reliant on manual input and more susceptible to human error. It becomes difficult to maintain real-time data, as you require a robust system in place to manage inventory changes, like updating shipments, use of material, destroying expired or obsolete products, and so on… all the time! This distracts your employees from value-added activities as they spend most of their time on admin tasks.\nManual Data Entry Results in Flawed Insights Administrative errors such as data entry result in 15.3% of inventory loss for small to medium-sized businesses. These errors can also impact other areas of your business such as customer experience.\nBecause of limitations in Excel’s data import features, teams end up manually entering data. You can easily enter SKUs or quantities erroneously, and the incorrect amount may not stand out among hundreds of others. These errors can result in an incorrect analysis of data which may be hard to spot if the variations in data entry errors are small.\nWithout the ability to track, trace, and account for every inventory transaction moving through a company’s supply chain, inventory levels will become inaccurate, impacting operations and customer service.\nExcel Inventory Management Causes Loss of Audit Trail The enormous data that accumulates over time becomes a crucial aspect of inventory management software. Besides exposing your inventory to errors and flawed insights, you may also expose your company to potential fraud.\nKey features such as user activity tracking or timestamps are not available in Excel and Google Sheets. It becomes difficult and almost impossible to trace products. It becomes a challenge in case a shipment needs to be recalled or when you are audited by authorities.\nAn effective inventory management software will allow you to establish an effective audit trail. For example, you can see when the data set was last updated and by whom, thus, boosting accountability and error prevention.\nNon-compliance If you are serious about getting regulatory audits or securing funding, you should reconsider using spreadsheets for inventory management. Excel requires a manual intervention which makes it hard to manage and scale along with your business.\nThe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has guidelines for inventory audits, which may be difficult to implement with inventory management Excel or Google Sheets. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offers guidelines for the taxation of inventory that can affect audit procedures.\nWithout inventory audit, you have lesser chances with banks and investors. Worse, it may lead to massive losses like Barclays who bought unwanted assets because it was hidden in Excel. Or Fannie May who lost $1.1B because of spreadsheets.\nThe manual data entry and loss of audit trail can cause delays and issues during audits. These are features which are simply not present in tools such as Excel and Google Sheets.\nLack of Scalability Inventory spreadsheets can be quite precise as they can perform calculations flawlessly. However, you need to constantly monitor and check calculation to ensure that crucial links are not broken or changed. This becomes a challenge as businesses grow and become more complex. Without automation, real-time inventory data is impossible to maintain.\nThese issues become even more complicated when you need to track inventory at multiple locations. Even more so when involved with a variety of processes that use different materials. With just an inventory management spreadsheet, maintaining these data entries would be next to impossible without external systems in place.\nFor industries that hold significant high-value stock such as Life Sciences \u0026amp; Healthcare, Solar \u0026amp; Renewables, Technology Enterprise Computing, consider changing Excel for an Alternative solution that can minimize risk while becoming a key enabler for growth.\nCloud-based Inventory Management Software: The Future of Inventory Management Cloud-based inventory management solutions, unlike spreadsheets, can immediately provide an accurate running tally of goods.
